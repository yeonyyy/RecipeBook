        "strInstructions": "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line the base and sides of a 20cm square tin with baking parchment (the easiest way is to cross 2 x 20cm-long strips over the base). To make the almond sponge, put the butter, sugar, flour, ground almonds, baking powder, eggs, vanilla and almond extract in a large bowl. Beat with an electric whisk until the mix comes together smoothly. Scrape into the tin, spreading to the corners, and bake for 25-30 mins – when you poke in a skewer, it should come out clean. Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling while you make the second sponge.\r\nFor the pink sponge, line the tin as above. Mix all the ingredients together as above, but don’t add the almond extract. Fold in some pink food colouring. Then scrape it all into the tin and bake as before. Cool.\r\nTo assemble, heat the jam in a small pan until runny, then sieve. Barely trim two opposite edges from the almond sponge, then well trim a third edge. Roughly measure the height of the sponge, then cutting from the well-trimmed edge, use a ruler to help you cut 4 slices each the same width as the sponge height. Discard or nibble leftover sponge. Repeat with pink cake.\r\nTake 2 x almond slices and 2 x pink slices and trim so they are all the same length. Roll out one marzipan block on a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar to just over 20cm wide, then keep rolling lengthways until the marzipan is roughly 0.5cm thick. Brush with apricot jam, then lay a pink and an almond slice side by side at one end of the marzipan, brushing jam in between to stick sponges, and leaving 4cm clear marzipan at the end. Brush more jam on top of the sponges, then sandwich remaining 2 slices on top, alternating colours to give a checkerboard effect. Trim the marzipan to the length of the cakes.\r\nCarefully lift up the marzipan and smooth over the cake with your hands, but leave a small marzipan fold along the bottom edge before you stick it to the first side. Trim opposite side to match size of fold, then crimp edges using fingers and thumb (or, more simply, press with prongs of fork). If you like, mark the 10 slices using the prongs of a fork.\r\nAssemble second Battenberg and keep in an airtight box or well wrapped in cling film for up to 3 days. Can be frozen for up to a month.",

When the ham is tender enough to pull into shreds, it is ready.\r\nLift out the ham, peel off and discard the skin. While it is still hot (wear a clean pair of rubber gloves), shred the meat. Remove bay from the soup and stir in the frozen peas. Simmer for 1 min, then blend until smooth. Add a splash of water if too thick, and return to the pan to heat through if it has cooled, or if you are making ahead.\r\nWhen you are ready to serve, mix the hot soup with most of the ham – gently reheat if made ahead. Serve in bowls with the remaining ham scattered on top, and eat with crusty bread and butter.",

    {"idMeal":"52890","strMeal":"Jam Roly-Poly","strDrinkAlternate":null,"strCategory":"Dessert","strArea":"British","strInstructions":"Put a deep roasting tin onto the bottom shelf of the oven, and make sure that there\u2019s another shelf directly above it. Pull the roasting tin out on its shelf, fill two-thirds with boiling water from the kettle, then carefully slide it back in. Heat oven to 180C\/160C fan\/gas 4. Tear off a large sheet of foil and greaseproof paper (about 30 x 40cm). Sit the greaseproof on top of the foil and butter it.\r\nTip butter, flour and vanilla seeds into a food processor; pulse until the butter has disappeared. Tip into a mixing bowl. Stir through the suet, pour in the milk and work together with a cutlery knife until you get a sticky dough. You may need a drop more milk, depending on your flour.\r\nTip the dough out onto a floured surface, quickly pat together to smooth, then roll out to a square roughly 25 x 25cm. Spread the jam all over, leaving a gap along one edge, then roll up from the opposite edge. Pinch the jam-free edge into the dough where it meets, and pinch the ends roughly, too. Carefully lift onto the greased paper, join-side down (you might find a flat baking sheet helpful for this), loosely bring up the paper and foil around it, then scrunch together along the edges and ends to seal. The roly-poly will puff quite a bit during cooking so don\u2019t wrap it tightly. Lift the parcel directly onto the rack above the tin and cook for 1 hr.\r\nLet the pudding sit for 5 mins before unwrapping, then carefully open the foil and paper, and thickly slice to serve.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/ysqupp1511640538.jpg","strTags":null,"strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5ZYWVQ8imVA","strIngredient1":"Butter","strIngredient2":"Self-raising Flour","strIngredient3":"Vanilla","strIngredient4":"Suet","strIngredient5":"Milk","strIngredient6":"Raspberry Jam","strIngredient7":"Custard","strIngredient8":"","strIngredient9":"","strIngredient10":"","strIngredient11":"","strIngredient12":"","strIngredient13":"","strIngredient14":"","strIngredient15":"","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"50g","strMeasure2":"250g","strMeasure3":"1 small","strMeasure4":"50g","strMeasure5":"150ml","strMeasure6":"100g ","strMeasure7":"to serve","strMeasure8":"","strMeasure9":"","strMeasure10":"","strMeasure11":"","strMeasure12":"","strMeasure13":"","strMeasure14":"","strMeasure15":"","strMeasure16":"","strMeasure17":"","strMeasure18":"","strMeasure19":"","strMeasure20":"","strSource":"https:\/\/www.bbcgoodfood.com\/recipes\/13354\/jam-rolypoly","strImageSource":null,"strCreativeCommonsConfirmed":null,"dateModified":null},
    {"idMeal":"52923","strMeal":"Canadian Butter Tarts","strDrinkAlternate":null,"strCategory":"Dessert","strArea":"Canadian","strInstructions":"Preheat the oven to fan 170C\/ conventional 190C\/gas 5. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface so it\u2019s slightly thinner than straight from the pack. Then cut out 18-20 rounds with a 7.5cm fluted cutter, re-rolling the trimmings. Use the rounds to line two deep 12-hole tart tins (not muffin tins). If you only have a regular-sized, 12-hole tart tin you will be able to make a few more slightly shallower tarts.\r\nBeat the eggs in a large bowl and combine with the rest of the ingredients except the walnuts. Tip this mixture into a pan and stir continuously for 3-4 minutes until the butter melts, and the mixture bubbles and starts to thicken. It should be thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Don\u2019t overcook, and be sure to stir all the time as the mixture can easily burn. Remove from the heat and stir in the nuts.\r\nSpoon the filling into the unbaked tart shells so it\u2019s level with the pastry. Bake for 15-18 minutes until set and pale golden. Leave in the tin to cool for a few minutes before lifting out on to a wire rack. Serve warm or cold.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/wpputp1511812960.jpg","strTags":"Speciality,Snack,Desert,Pudding","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WUpaOGghOdo","strIngredient1":"Shortcrust Pastry","strIngredient2":"Eggs","strIngredient3":"Muscovado Sugar","strIngredient4":"Raisins","strIngredient5":"Vanilla Extract","strIngredient6":"Butter","strIngredient7":"Single Cream","strIngredient8":"Walnuts","strIngredient9":"","strIngredient10":"","strIngredient11":"","strIngredient12":"","strIngredient13":"","strIngredient14":"","strIngredient15":"","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"375g","strMeasure2":"2 large","strMeasure3":"175g","strMeasure4":"100g ","strMeasure5":"1 tsp ","strMeasure6":"50g","strMeasure7":"4 tsp","strMeasure8":"50g","strMeasure9":"","strMeasure10":"","strMeasure11":"","strMeasure12":"","strMeasure13":"","strMeasure14":"","strMeasure15":"","strMeasure16":"","strMeasure17":"","strMeasure18":"","strMeasure19":"","strMeasure20":"","strSource":"https:\/\/www.bbcgoodfood.com\/recipes\/1837\/canadian-butter-tarts","strImageSource":null,"strCreativeCommonsConfirmed":null,"dateModified":null},
    {"idMeal":"52937","strMeal":"Jerk chicken with rice & peas","strDrinkAlternate":null,"strCategory":"Chicken","strArea":"Jamaican","strInstructions":"To make the jerk marinade, combine all the ingredients in a food processor along with 1 tsp salt, and blend to a pur\u00e9e. If you\u2019re having trouble getting it to blend, just keep turning off the blender, stirring the mixture, and trying again. Eventually it will start to blend up \u2013 don\u2019t be tempted to add water, as you want a thick paste.\r\n\r\nTaste the jerk mixture for seasoning \u2013 it should taste pretty salty, but not unpleasantly, puckering salty. You can now throw in more chillies if it\u2019s not spicy enough for you. If it tastes too salty and sour, try adding in a bit more brown sugar until the mixture tastes well balanced.\r\n\r\nMake a few slashes in the chicken thighs and pour the marinade over the meat, rubbing it into all the crevices. Cover and leave to marinate overnight in the fridge.\r\n\r\nIf you want to barbecue your chicken, get the coals burning 1 hr or so before you\u2019re ready to cook. Authentic jerked meats are not exactly grilled as we think of grilling, but sort of smoke-grilled. To get a more authentic jerk experience, add some wood chips to your barbecue, and cook your chicken over slow, indirect heat for 30 mins. To cook in the oven, heat to 180C\/160C fan\/gas 4. Put the chicken pieces in a roasting tin with the lime halves and cook for 45 mins until tender and cooked through.\r\n\r\nWhile the chicken is cooking, prepare the rice & peas. Rinse the rice in plenty of cold water, then tip it into a large saucepan with all the remaining ingredients except the kidney beans. Season with salt, add 300ml cold water and set over a high heat. Once the rice begins to boil, turn it down to a medium heat, cover and cook for 10 mins.\r\n\r\nAdd the beans to the rice, then cover with a lid. Leave off the heat for 5 mins until all the liquid is absorbed. Squeeze the roasted lime over the chicken and serve with the rice & peas, and some hot sauce if you like it really spicy.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/tytyxu1515363282.jpg","strTags":"Chilli,Curry","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qfchrS2D_v4","strIngredient1":"Chicken Thighs","strIngredient2":"Lime","strIngredient3":"Spring Onions","strIngredient4":"Ginger","strIngredient5":"Garlic","strIngredient6":"Onion","strIngredient7":"Red Chilli","strIngredient8":"Thyme","strIngredient9":"Lime","strIngredient10":"Soy Sauce","strIngredient11":"Vegetable Oil","strIngredient12":"Brown Sugar","strIngredient13":"Allspice","strIngredient14":"Basmati Rice","strIngredient15":"Coconut Milk","strIngredient16":"Spring Onions","strIngredient17":"Thyme","strIngredient18":"Garlic","strIngredient19":"Allspice","strIngredient20":"Kidney Beans","strMeasure1":"12","strMeasure2":"1\/2 ","strMeasure3":"1  bunch","strMeasure4":"1 tbs chopped","strMeasure5":"3 cloves","strMeasure6":"1\/2 ","strMeasure7":"3 chopped","strMeasure8":"1\/2 teaspoon","strMeasure9":"Juice of 1","strMeasure10":"2 tbs","strMeasure11":"2 tbs","strMeasure12":"3 tbs","strMeasure13":"1 tbs","strMeasure14":"200g","strMeasure15":"400g","strMeasure16":"1  bunch","strMeasure17":"2 sprigs","strMeasure18":"2 cloves chopped","strMeasure19":"1 tbs","strMeasure20":"800g","strSource":"https:\/\/www.bbcgoodfood.com\/recipes\/2369635\/jerk-chicken-with-rice-and-peas","strImageSource":null,"strCreativeCommonsConfirmed":null,"dateModified":null},

Leave for 5 mins then drain in a sieve and leave to dry.\r\nPreheat the oven to 180C\/160 C fan\/Gas Mark 4. Line a deep loose-based 20cm cake tin with baking parchment.\r\nPut the butter in a large bowl and beat well until soft. Add the sugar and beat until light and fluffy. Stir in the orange zest and apricot jam.\r\nSieve together the flour and baking powder. Add the eggs to the creamed butter and sugar, a little at a time, beating well between each addition. If the mixture starts to curdle, stir in a little flour.\r\nAdd the remaining flour and ground almonds and mix well. Mix in the milk and then add the dried fruit and cherries and mix gently together.\r\nSpoon the mixture into the prepared tin and spread level using the back of a spoon. Arrange the whole almonds close together in neat circles on the top of the cake. Bake in the oven for 45 mins.\r\nLower the oven temperature to 160C\/140 C fan\/Gas Mark 3 and cook for a further 60\u201380 minutes. Check the cake after 50 minutes by inserting a wooden or metal skewer into the cake. When it\u2019s done it should have just a few crumbs attached. Check every 10 minutes - it\u2019s important not to overcook this cake so the centre will be a little soft.\r\nWhen cooked, remove the cake briefly from the oven, put the milk and sugar into a small pan and heat gently until the sugar has dissolved. Brush over the top of the cake and return the cake to the oven for 2-3 mins. Remove and allow the cake to cool in the tin. When quite cold remove from the tin and wrap in foil and keep for at least 2 days before cutting.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/wxyvqq1511723401.jpg","strTags":"heavy,Nutty,Fruity","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4hEXsfpeMQE","strIngredient1":"Almonds","strIngredient2":"Butter","strIngredient3":"Muscovado Sugar","strIngredient4":"Orange","strIngredient5":"Apricot Jam","strIngredient6":"Plain Flour","strIngredient7":"Baking Powder","strIngredient8":"Eggs","strIngredient9":"Ground Almonds","strIngredient10":"Milk","strIngredient11":"Dried Fruit","strIngredient12":"Glace Cherry","strIngredient13":"Milk","strIngredient14":"Caster Sugar","strIngredient15":"","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"100g ","strMeasure2":"180g","strMeasure3":"180g","strMeasure4":"Zest of 1","strMeasure5":"3 tbs","strMeasure6":"225g","strMeasure7":"1 tsp ","strMeasure8":"3 Large","strMeasure9":"100g ","strMeasure10":"2 tbs","strMeasure11":"500g","strMeasure12":"100g ","strMeasure13":"1 tbs","strMeasure14":"2 tsp","strMeasure15":"","strMeasure16":"","strMeasure17":"","strMeasure18":"","strMeasure19":"","strMeasure20":"","strSource":"https:\/\/www.bbcgoodfood.com\/recipes\/2155640\/dundee-cake","strImageSource":null,"strCreativeCommonsConfirmed":null,"dateModified":null}
